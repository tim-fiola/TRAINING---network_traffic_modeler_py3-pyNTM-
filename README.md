# Update - Jan 19, 2021

I've updated training module 2 and added the visualation training module pdf files.  

The big new feature in 3.0 is an interactive visualization weathermap (in beta status), which allows the user to visualize the network map and things like LSP and traffic demand paths.  

The weathermap also allows the user to quickly switch between a selected LSP, traffic Demand, and associated Interfaces.  There are examples in the repository's 'examples' directory here: https://github.com/tim-fiola/network_traffic_modeler_py3/tree/master/examples.  
* https://github.com/tim-fiola/network_traffic_modeler_py3/blob/master/examples/network_modeling_with_visualization.py
* https://github.com/tim-fiola/network_traffic_modeler_py3/blob/master/examples/parallel_link_model_with_visualization.py

The training module 2 is updated to include how to use the `path_detail` demand attribute, another really cool feature added in pyNTM 3.0.


More info is available in the pyNTM repository wiki: https://github.com/tim-fiola/network_traffic_modeler_py3/wiki/Visualizing-the-network-with-the-WeatherMap-Class-(beta).

Thank you!
